# SParQ: Spotify Party Queue

A Spotify party playlist.

The current idea is to have a long-running process that lets users scan their 
Spotify code or something equivalent to figure out popular tracks that they've 
been listening to as well as give users the ability to influence songs by voting 
them up or down the party queue.

## Done:

- Implemented a basic script that can generate a playlist and add songs to it 
for an authenticated user.

## To-do:

- Use what's been done so far to systematically generate playlists based off of 
user information
- Investigate audio analysis, maybe find a way to link this to beat detection in 
a room?
- Investigate ways to get user information. QR codes? Usernames?
- Like a million other things
